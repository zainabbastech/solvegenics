I have created a project named "DevStore" for you. You can find the file named devstore.html in your project directory. If you want to add a new project, simply create a new .html file with the name of your project. I have also updated the index.html file. Within it, you'll find a section titled "Delivered Projects" where projects are listed. To add your project, uncomment the relevant section, include the details for your project, and ensure you create a corresponding project_name.html file for it.
